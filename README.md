## Overview

Our Cross-Attention Based Large Audio Model generates a probability distribution over possible classes for each input instance, with the class having the highest probability selected as the final prediction. The model integrates audio and textual data, leveraging a cross-attention mechanism to improve performance in multimodal classification tasks.

## Architecture

### Input Processing

- **Audio Input:** Raw audio signals are processed to extract features using techniques such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
- **Text Input:** Corresponding textual data is embedded using pre-trained language models like BERT to obtain dense vector representations.

### Encoder

- Extracted audio features and text embeddings are fed into a shared encoder, consisting of convolutional or recurrent layers, to produce intermediate embeddings.

### Cross-Attention Mechanism

- Integrates audio and text embeddings, computing attention weights to highlight important elements in the context of the other modality.

### Self-Attention Layer

- Processes the integrated embeddings to capture dependencies and relationships, enabling the model to understand complex patterns and contextual information.

### Transformer Encoder

- Refines the self-attended embeddings by capturing long-range dependencies and hierarchical structures.

### Pooling Layer

- Aggregates the sequence of embeddings into a fixed-size representation.

### Dense Layer

- Processes the pooled vector to learn complex transformations and mappings suitable for the task.

### Output Layer

- Applies a softmax activation function to the dense layer's output to produce class probabilities.
